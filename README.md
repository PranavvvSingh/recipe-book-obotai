# Project Title

A Recipe Book application made using React.js, Radix/ui, TailwindCSS & Redux that allows users to browse and view different
recipes fetched from spoonacular api.
Users can  search for a particular recipe and also apply various filters to narrow down searches.
Note: Api Responses are limited to 4 recipes since I am using the free plan.
